### TPS Competition Questionnaire

*Please replace the square brackets and the text in it with your answers*

**Number of CPUs**

[How many logical CPUs does the machine have for running one cluster?]

**Memory (GB)**

[How much memory does the machine have for running one cluster? For example, 16G.]

**Storage (GB)**

[Note down both the type and capacity of the storage on one machine. For example, SSD 1024G.]

**Network**

[Comment on the network connecting clusters. For example, 1 Gbps LAN]

**Machine Type (Optional)**

[If you are using public cloud service, note down the name of the provider and the machine type. For example, AWS EC2 m5.2xlarge.]

**Command Lines for Running Cluster**
```

**Peak TPS**

[Note down the highest TPS observed.]

**Video URL**

[URL for the video showing how you produced the above TPS.]

**Output From `stats` Tool**
```
[Copy the complete output from `stats` here. It should capture the cluster configuration and at least 10 minute continuous samples (60 rows) with at least one sample showing the TPS claimed above.]
```

**Additional Comment**

[If you have special setup, e.g., running a single cluster over multiple machines, the above questionnaire might not fit. Note down
whatever you want us to know here to help evaluate the result.]
