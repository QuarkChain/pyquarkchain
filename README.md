# QuarkChain

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=c17a071129e4ab6c0911154c955efc236b1a5015)](https://circleci.com/gh/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/tree/master)

QuarkChain is a sharded blockchain protocol that employs a two-layer architecture - one extensible sharding layer consisting of multiple shard chains processing transactions and one root chain layer securing the network and coordinating cross-shard transactions among shard chains. The capacity of the network scales linearly as the number of shard chains increase while the root chain is always providing strong security guarantee regardless of the number of shards. QuarkChain testnet consistently hit [10,000+ TPS](https://youtu.be/dUldrq3zKwE?t=8m28s) with 256 shards run by 50 clusters consisting of 6450 servers with each loadtest submitting 3,000,000 transactions to the network.

## Features

- Cluster implementation allowing multiple processes / physical machines to work together as a single full node
- State sharding dividing global state onto independent processing and storage units allowing the network capacity to scale linearly by adding more shards
- Cross-shard transaction allowing native token transfers among shard chains
- Adding shards dynamically to the network
- Support of different mining algorithms on different shards
- P2P network allowing clusters to join and leave anytime
- Fully compatible with Ethereum smart contract

## Design

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/wiki) to understand the design of QuarkChain.

## Development Setup

QuarkChain should be run using [pypy](http://pypy.org/index.html) for better performance.

### OSX

To install pypy3 on OSX, first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then install pypy3 and other dependencies

```bash
brew install pypy3 gmp pkg-config openssl
```

It's is highly recommended to use [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) creating an isolated python environment for your project so that the python modules installed later will only affect this environment.

To clone the code to your target directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain.git
cd pyquarkchain
```

To create a virtual environment

```bash
mkdir ~/virtualenv
pypy3 -m venv ~/virtualenv/qc
```

As the virtual env is created with pypy3 once the env is activated all the python and pip commands will point to their pypy3 versions automatically.

To activate the virtual environment

```bash
source ~/virtualenv/qc/bin/activate
```

Install rocksdb which is required by the `python-rocksdb` module in the next step

```bash
brew install rocksdb
```

To install the required modules for the project. Under `pyquarkchain` dir where `setup.py` is located

```bash
# you may want to set the following if cryptography complains about header files: (https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/3489)
# export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
# export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
pip install -e .
```

Once all the modules are installed, try running all the unit tests under `pyquarkchain`

```
pypy3 -m unittest
pypy3 -m pytest quarkchain/p2p # some tests are written in py.test
```

### Linux

Using Ubuntu as the example, with similar procedures as in OSX, following snippet should be the minimum viable setup.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y git gcc make libffi-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libsqlite3-dev libncurses5-dev libexpat1-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev \
libgc-dev python-cffi \
liblzma-dev libncursesw5-dev libgmp-dev liblz4-dev librocksdb-dev \
libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libzstd-dev

wget https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy3-v6.0.0-linux64.tar.bz2
sudo tar -x -C /opt -f  pypy3-v6.0.0-linux64.tar.bz2
sudo mv /opt/pypy3-v6.0.0-linux64 /opt/pypy3
sudo ln -s /opt/pypy3/bin/pypy3 /usr/local/bin/pypy3

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
pypy3 get-pip.py --user
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
rm get-pip.py

git clone https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain.git
cd pyquarkchain
pip install --user -e .

# https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp/issues/274#issuecomment-385268798
pip uninstall pyelliptic
pip install --user https://github.com/mfranciszkiewicz/pyelliptic/archive/1.5.10.tar.gz#egg=pyelliptic

pypy3 -m unittest  # should succeed
```

Furthermore, we provided a public AMI in US West (Oregon) Region *QuarkChain Sample AMI* **ami-03845bc95e90d1c12** using this setup.

However, `librocksdb-dev` installed in this way won't have support for LZ4 compression, running `pypy3 quarkchain/cluster/cluster.py` would fail with the error `Compression type LZ4 is not linked with the binary`. To fix this, you can either build rocksdb from source (which will detect LZ4 support automatically):

```bash
# make sure librocksdb-dev is uninstalled: sudo apt-get purge librocksdb-dev
# cd ~  # or wherever you like
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
cd rocksdb && make shared_lib  # will probably take 10~20 min
sudo make install-shared
# go back to pyquarkchain directory
pip uninstall python-rocksdb
pip install --user --no-cache-dir python-rocksdb  # force reinstalling
```

or change the the compression type in `quarkchain/db.py` 

```python
options.compression = rocksdb.CompressionType.lz4_compression
```

to 

```python
options.compression = rocksdb.CompressionType.snappy_compression
```

then running `pypy3 quarkchain/cluster/cluster.py  --mine` should suceed.

## Development Flow

[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) is used to manage git hooks.

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

[black](https://github.com/ambv/black) is used to format modified python code, which will be automatically triggered on new commit after running the above commands. Refer to [STYLE](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/blob/master/STYLE) for coding style suggestions.

## Run Cluster

Start running a cluster. The default cluster has 8 shards and 4 slaves.

```bash
cd quarkchain/cluster
pypy3 cluster.py --mine
```

Run multiple clusters with P2P network on a single machine (--mine turns on mining on one cluster)

```bash
pypy3 multi_cluster.py --num_clusters=3 --mine --devp2p_enable
```

Run multiple clusters with P2P network on different machines. Just follow the same command to run single cluster and provide `--devp2p_ip` and `--devp2p_bootstrap_host` to connect the clusters. You need to figure out the IPs yourself before starting the clusters, just make sure that the machines are reachable from other clusters using the IP you specified. (Make sure ports are open in firewall as well)
First start the bootstrap cluster whose public ip is `$BOOTSTRAP_IP`
```bash
pypy3 cluster.py --mine --devp2p_enable --devp2p_ip=$BOOTSTRAP_IP
```
Then start other clusters
```bash
pypy3 cluster.py --devp2p_enable --devp2p_ip=$CLUSER_PUBLIC_IP --devp2p_bootstrap_host=$BOOTSTRAP_IP
```

## Monitor Cluster
Use the [`stats`](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/blob/master/quarkchain/tools/stats) tool in the repo to monitor the status of a cluster. It queries the given cluster through JSON RPC every 10 seconds and produces an entry.
```bash
$ quarkchain/tools/stats --ip=localhost

## JSON RPC
JSON RPCs are defined in [`jsonrpc.py`](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/blob/master/quarkchain/cluster/jsonrpc.py). Note that there are two JSON RPC ports. By default they are 38491 for private RPCs and 38391 for public RPCs. Since you are running your own clusters you get access to both.

Public RPCs are documented in the [Developer Guide](https://developers.quarkchain.io/#json-rpc). You can use the client library [quarkchain-web3.js](https://github.com/QuarkChain/quarkchain-web3.js) to query account state, send transactions, deploy and call smart contracts. Here is [a simple example](https://gist.github.com/qcgg/1ab0352c5b2299270b5795648cca83d8) to deploy smart contract on QuarkChain using the client library.

You may find a list of accounts with tokens preallocated through the genesis blocks [here](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/blob/master/quarkchain/genesis_data/alloc.json). Feel free to use any of them to issue transactions.

## Loadtest
Follow [this wiki page](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain/wiki/Loadtest) to loadtest your cluster and see how fast it processes large volumn of transacations.
